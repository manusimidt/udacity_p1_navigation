```python
    _agent = Agent(_state_size, _action_size, hidden_sizes=[64, 64],
                   gamma=0.992, lr=0.008, tau=0.002,
                   buffer_size=100000, batch_size=64, update_rate=5,
                   seed=0)

scores = train_agent(_env, _brain_name, _agent, n_episodes=1000,
                     eps_start=1, eps_decay=0.995, eps_end=0)
```

### Notes:

> Looks like policy is not that good,
> the score suddenly drops 800 episodes as epsilon gets smaller and smaller...
