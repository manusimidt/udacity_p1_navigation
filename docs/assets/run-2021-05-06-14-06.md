```python

_agent = Agent(_state_size, _action_size, hidden_sizes=[70, 64],
               gamma=0.992, lr=0.0005, tau=0.002,
               buffer_size=100000, batch_size=64, update_rate=10,
               seed=0)

scores = train_agent(_env, _brain_name, _agent, n_episodes=1000,
                     eps_start=1, eps_decay=0.995, eps_cutoff=500, eps_end=0.01)

```

### Notes:

> For this test I rapidly cut down epsilon to eps_end at the 500th episode.
> Looking at the moving average score: i think the rapid score increase after the
> 500th episode is attributable to the eps_cutoff
